## About My Project

**My research project is concerned with working on Hidden Markov models for analyzing ECOG data.**

The big goal is to implement a pipeline in MATLAB able to extract brain states form existing FC dynamics. Functional Connectivity (FC) is defined as temporal dependence of brain signals between pairs of distinct brain areas, while FC dynamics relate to changes in FC over time. Studies have reported that FC dynamics are made up of a mixture of several hidden components. In this project, the intetnion is to use the Hidden Markov Model method to disentangle FC dynamics into several perpendicular brain state dynamics.

_This project entails:_

  1. Literature review on the introduction to HMM and the concept of brain states
  2. Getting familiar with existing data preprocessing pipelines and with the structure of existing FC dynamics
  3. Implementing HMM to estract the brain states
  4. Visualizing said results and interpreting them
