This week, I worked on creating null distributions for the data by phase-permuting the data and computing the correlations. I researched and met with my PhD student to better understand the Fourier Transform and the idea behind the phase-permuting. Then I used the null distributions to determine the significance of the correlations in the actual data with a 95% confidence. This entailed creating graphs to better display the data.
