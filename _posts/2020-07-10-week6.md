title: Week 5

This week I extracted HMM from non z-scored data (I had been working with z-scored data before) to extract state specific functional conductivities. From this data, I computed correlations between z-scored data (which filters out baseline activity to only keep task-related activity) and non z-scored data. We discussed the findings which aligned with the previous paper's fidnings of the PhD student I'm working with. Following this, I extended the analysis to more subjects (previously I had only been working on one). The results were pretty robust. Also, I learned more about the purpose and idea behind the research.
