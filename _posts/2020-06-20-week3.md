title: Week 3

In the past two weeks, I familiarized myself with the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) algorithm, Fourier Transform, and a Matlab toolbox that uses HMM to analyze brain data. Right now, I am using that toolbox to analyze data collected from epileptic patients undergoing brain surgery, so the device, unlike EEG, is directly on top of their brains. So far, implementing the toolbox has not been particularly difficult, given that I previously read the entirety of the documentation and took notes. However, I have found that the documentation is not as thorough as it should be and many functions are not outlined, which is a bit of a hassle. I will continue looking around the wiki and hopefully find something, but I have come to terms with the possibility of there not being anything. We will see.
To end on a lighter note, I am in the Eagle County in Colorado and have gone to two hikes on the mountains. The first one was not particularly dangerous, but the last one went by a deep chasm, a huge waterfall, and up a rocky mountain. I drank water from above the waterfall, which comes from a lake on the top of the mountain, and it was pristinely pure.
